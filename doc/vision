	Void Bubble is a game where the goal is to achieve the highest
score. The player is an alien creature who must defend itself
against alien aggressors which attack in increasing waves. The
player uses various weapons gained after beating a level, employs
shields gained from pick-ups to protected itself from enemy attacks,
and deploys limited large-range special area-attacks.
