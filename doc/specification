  This game is a 2D, top down, omnidirectional shooter. It will
be controlled by keyboard and mouse. Aiming is independent of movement.
The player will be confined in a small space called a "level".
The enemies will "appear" at the edges of levels or at special
"spawn points", and head towards the player in a manner specific
to that type of enemy's attack pattern. If the enemies contact
the player, the player explodes, and the game is over.
This game will use basic shapes and colors to accomplish visuals,
mostly by rendering primitives and lines. It will have sound and music,
particle effects, and use simple collision detection. There will be
multiple weapons types, multiple enemy types, and multiple level
environments, but those levels will repeat after a complete set.
The set of levels culminates in a boss fight level, after which the
enemies will be increased in number and difficulty.

It is a Java based game, using the third party library LWJGL

Detailed installation instructions here:

***********text from the second link*************
The preferred way is to set it on the lwjgl.jar library as described below
and in the Eclipse Guide for jME - step 10.

Assuming you have already added the lwjgl.jar to your project -
locate it in the libraries (project properties → java build path →
libraries tab. Now expand the branch, and you should see
"Native library location". Select this, then click edit.
Now click workspace, and browse to you JME project → lib → lwjgl →
native → <whatever OS you are using> either linux, macosx, solaris or windows.


Edit 1:
Using TWL's PNGDecoder to load transparent .PNG files.
Edit 2:
No longer using TWL's PNGDecoder. Using Slick-Util library.
