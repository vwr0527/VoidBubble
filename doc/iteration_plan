==========================================================
Iteration X:
TODO:
0. Give the game a game over screen!
1. Fix the level border collision. Should not just reverse velocity on impact. Bug where the player sticks into the walls.
2. Find a better collision detection system. Should be a centralized object. A single interaction produces calculations for a pair of entities.
3. Add menu system. Would be nice to find a way to avoid creating a different object for each menu entry. IE: A separate class for ResolutionSliderX, a separate class for FrameRateAdjuster, a separate class for DifficultyAdjuster... etc.
4. Make levels dynamic. Detect if goals have been achieved.
5. Finish scoring system.
6. More enemy types.
